# PlantMom App

Plantmom allows users to track their plants and view other user's plants for ideas and inspiration, in the hopes of making plant logging an enjoyable experience. 


## Installation

To get Plantmom up and running, fork and clone this repo:

```ruby
git@github.com:allisoncortez/plantmom.git
```

You'll need to cd into the project directory and run 'bundle install'. All the gem dependancies will then be installed.

## Running Tests

In the terminal, please run "shotgun". It will open up a local server address where you can route to that address and look at the project. It will look something like this:

```ruby
http://127.0.0.1:9494/
```


## App Navigation

The first window users are greeted with is a welcome page!
You will need to log in or sign up for an account.
Once you are able to successfully create an account, it's time to navigate through the app.

Add the top left, you'll see the main nav bar, giving you the following options:
1. Add a Plant
2. All Plants
3. My Plants (this lets you view the plants you've logged)
4. Logout
